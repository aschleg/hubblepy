        are using NASA's Hubble Space Telescope to study auroras \u2014 stunning light
        shows in a planet's atmosphere \u2014 on the poles of the largest planet in
        the solar system, Jupiter. The auroras were photographed during a series of
        Hubble Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph far-ultraviolet-light observations
        taking place as NASA's Juno spacecraft approaches and enters into orbit around
        Jupiter. The aim of the program is to determine how Jupiter's auroras respond
        to changing conditions in the solar wind, a stream of charged particles emitted
        from the sun. Auroras are formed when charged particles in the space surrounding
        the planet are accelerated to high energies along the planet's magnetic field.
        When the particles hit the atmosphere near the magnetic poles, they cause
        it to glow like gases in a fluorescent light fixture. Jupiter's magnetosphere
        is 20,000 times stronger than Earth's. These observations will reveal how
        the solar system's largest and most powerful magnetosphere behaves.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe
        full-color disk of Jupiter in this image was separately photographed at a
        different time by Hubble's Outer Planet Atmospheres Legacy (OPAL) program,
        a long-term Hubble project that annually captures global maps of the outer
        planets.\",\"credits\":\"Credit: \\u003ca href=\\\"http://www.nasa.gov/\\\"\\u003eNASA\\u003c/a\\u003e,
