        Venus, Earth, and Mars) are the rocky objects, and the outer planets (Jupiter,
        Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) are the gaseous ones.\"},{\"name\":\"Planetary

        that are neighbors of the Milky Way.\"},{\"name\":\"Dwarf Planet\",\"definition\":\"A
        celestial body within the solar system that shares the characteristics of
        planets. It orbits the Sun, is not a moon, and has a spherical or nearly spherical
        shape. Unlike a planet, however, a dwarf planet has not cleared away any loose
        cosmic rubble from its orbit. Dwarf planets include Ceres, Pluto, and Eris.\"},{\"name\":\"Earth\",\"definition\":\"The
        third planet from the Sun and one of four terrestrial planets in the inner

        planet that orbits a star other than the sun.\"},{\"name\":\"Galaxy\",\"definition\":\"A
        collection of stars, gas, and dust bound together by gravity. The smallest
        galaxies may contain only a few hundred thousand stars, while the largest
        galaxies have thousands of billions of stars. The Milky Way galaxy contains
        our solar system. Galaxies are classified or grouped by their shape. Round
        or oval galaxies are elliptical galaxies and those showing a pinwheel structure
        are spiral galaxies. All others are called irregular because they do not resemble
