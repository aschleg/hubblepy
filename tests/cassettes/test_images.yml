        image shows a massive galaxy cluster embedded in the middle of a field of
        nearly 8,000 galaxies scattered across space and time. This \\\"galaxies galore\\\"\x9D
        snapshot is from a new Hubble Space Telescope survey to boldly expand its
        view by significantly enlarging the area covered around huge galaxy clusters
        previously photographed by Hubble.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe program, called Beyond Ultra-deep
        Frontier Fields And Legacy Observations (BUFFALO), is built around the six
        massive galaxy clusters that Hubble first observed under its Frontier Fields
        program.   \\r\\n\\r\\nIn this view the huge cluster Abell 370, located about
        4 billion light-years away, lies in the center of this image. It contains
        several hundred galaxies. The mosaic of fields flanking the cluster contains
        myriad background galaxies flung across space and time.  \\r\\n\\r\\nMassive
        galaxy clusters like Abell 370 are mainly composed of dark matter. Their large
        masses distort space, turning them into gravitational lenses that magnify
        and distort the light coming from distant background galaxies. The Frontier
        Fields program, a previous joint effort from NASA's Great Observatories to
        study several clusters, allowed for the discovery of background galaxies and
        supernovas that are so distant and faint that they could not have been photographed
        by Hubble without the aid of this additional gravitational amplification.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe
        regions that Hubble will map for BUFFALO were previously observed by NASA\u2019s
        Spitzer Space Telescope for the Frontier Fields program, in which Spitzer
        and Hubble worked together to detect and study some of the universe\u2019s
        earliest galaxies. Spitzer imaged a much larger area of the sky than Hubble
        but could not measure the distances to the galaxies it observed in those regions.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith
        BUFFALO, Hubble is now coming back to the full area of sky covered by Spitzer,
        to measure the distances to thousands of galaxies. This is important because
        the six fields observed by Hubble are relatively small and might not fully
        represent the number of early galaxies in the wider universe. Abell 370 is
        the first cluster to be observed.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn important motive for the BUFFALO
        program is the possibility that there may be significantly fewer than predicted
        extremely distant galaxies found in the Frontier Fields survey. This led astronomers
        to propose expanding the search area around each Frontier Fields cluster to
        seek out more distant galaxies, and therefore more accurately determine the
        numbers of such galaxies.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the Frontier Fields have already
        discovered some of the earliest galaxies, these fields are comparatively small
        and so may not represent the universe at large. This dilemma for cosmologists
        is called cosmic variance. By expanding the survey area, such uncertainties
        in the structure of the universe can be reduced.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis means conducting
        a concise census of the first galaxies in as wide of an area as feasible.
        The goal is to improve the probability of identifying some of the rare regions
        of space with a concentration of early galaxies and the far more common regions
        that had not yet been able to form galaxies so quickly.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause
        Frontier Fields observations have already established what the first galaxies
        look like, the wider area of BUFFALO will enable searches for these galaxies
        several times more efficiently than the original Frontier Fields. It will
        also take advantage of observations from other space telescopes, including
        ultra-deep Spitzer Space Telescope observations that already exist around
        these clusters.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe BUFFALO program is designed to identify galaxies
        in their earliest stages of formation, less than 800 million years after the
        big bang. These galaxies should help shed light on the processes by which
        galaxies first assembled. One of BUFFALO\u2019s key goals is to determine
        how rapidly galaxies formed in this early epoch. This will help astronomers
